1.)regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
    
    I will admit there are so many thinks to practice and I would say my accuracy needs alot of work

2.)regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

    Code reviews allow the programmer to write readable code in a group work environment.

3.)regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

    I would at least remind students that then can download the reading materials in
    different file formats, which seem like not being mentioned.
